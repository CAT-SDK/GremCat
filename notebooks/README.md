# Notebooks
 
You can edit and run the notebooks in Google Colab by selecting `File` -> `Playground Mode` after you open the notebook. The database password is a round vegetable that is sometimes pickled and whose name rhymes with "Babbage" (all lowercase). Make sure to run the *"Setup"* cell at the very top (code is hidden) before running any other cells.
