# Notebooks

This directory contains a (growing) set of notebooks that illustrate different types of analysis using repository and other development-related data (e.g., issues, emails). 

## How to run the notebooks
### Option 1 (preferred): Using Google Colab (You will need to login to your Google account)
1. Click on the [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]() button for the notebook you wish to run in the table bellow.
2. You can _edit_ and run the notebooks in Google Colab by selecting `File` -> `Playground Mode` after you open the notebook. The database password is a round vegetable that is sometimes pickled and whose name rhymes with "Babbage" (all lowercase). Make sure to run the *"Setup"* cell at the very top (code is hidden) before running any other cells. You can save notebooks or full sessions in your own Google Drive.
